## Getting Started

For local development, install dependencies with `npm i`, then link your local repo with Vercel (along with the environment variables there):
```
vercel link
vercel env pull
```

To run the development server: 
```
npm run dev
```
Then reference [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) for the result.

## Getting Started

For local development, install dependencies with `npm i`, then link your local repo with Vercel (along with the environment variables there):
```
vercel link
vercel env pull
```

To run the development server: 
```
npm run dev
```
Then reference [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) for the result.

## Timeline Design

### 1. 

Ivan -> Grand Inquisitor (role-play; user be Alyosha, try to convince Ivan)

Fyodor -> about all his past wives (and negligence in raising his children), affairs, Grushenka, beef with Dmitry

Father Zossima -> role-play; user be Alyosha, talk to Zossima before his death; incorporate Alyosha's writings about Zossima's life story & teachings

### 2. 

Alyosha -> wedding at Cana moment

Dmitry -> wedding at Cana moment (Mokroe)

Grushenka -> onion story (?)

### 3. 

Dmitry -> trial (role-play; user be the judges)

Ivan -> conversation with the devil (role-play; user be Ivan)

Smerdyakov -> right before he commits suicide

### 4. 

Katerina -> at trial (after hysterics over Ivan)



## To-Do: 

1. Create timeline (backend to implement time & different characters), includes frontend - Jason
2. Create map overlaid with characters & places with hovering effect (character becomes bigger when hovering over it); ("talk to me!"/"Enter into a role-play!") - Haojin
3. Prompt engineering - half/half
4. Optimize for cost lol
5. Figure out API tokens (Haojin can run the app without pulling environment variables??)
